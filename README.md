# Starting-Strength-Tracker
Python terminal program to track starting strength progress on big four lifts
Upon opening program for first time, the program will see if a user.json file exists in SSTracker folder
if no such file exists, the program will prompt you to create a profile
once you complete the setup process, your input will be stored in a json file stored in SSTracker
After which, you can choose from the options available and start tracking your progress
This current version only supports tracking benchpress, press, squat and deadlift
Starting Strength eventually gets you doing chin ups, powercleans/barbell row
These will eventually be added
